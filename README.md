[00:14.28] When your stars are...
[00:19.75] And your rivers fly
[00:21.54] Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky?
[00:28.19] When your...
[00:34.19] 
[00:43.94] When your stars are baked and your rivers fly
[00:47.41] Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky?
[00:54.29] When your castle breaks and your feet are dry
[00:57.15] Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky?
[01:20.15] 
[01:05.02] Do you believe, when you're high
[01:10.82] That your life is tried?
[01:22.82] 
[01:17.14] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[01:20.68] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[01:23.84] Don't ever get stuck in the sky when you're high
[01:47.84] 
[01:42.78] When your moon is fake and your mermaids cry
[01:46.54] Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky?
[01:52.94] When your tunnel fades and your guide is shy
[01:56.29] Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky?
[02:21.29] 
[02:03.89] Do you believe, when you're high
[02:10.05] That your life is tried?
[02:22.05] 
[02:16.64] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[02:25.62] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[02:26.63] Don't ever get stuck in the sky when you're high
[02:33.86] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[02:36.05] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[02:37.35] Don't ever get stuck in the sky when you're high
[03:01.35] 
[03:32.80] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[03:34.86] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[03:37.90] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[03:41.49] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[03:44.46] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[03:47.58] Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
[03:50.87] Don't ever get stuck in the sky when you're high
