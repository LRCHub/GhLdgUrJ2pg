What did she ever do to you?
Can't help bein' born
At the wrong time in your sick little world
Impaled by Satan's horn

Locked in a closet
Without any clothes on
Mommy knows that she been peeping through a hole

Surviving on her own human waste
Just hold on day by day
Yeah, surely something's gonna come
A white light is on its way

Locked in a closet
Without any clothes
Mommy knows that she been peeping through a hole

They're watching their TV
Fucking on the floor
Mommy knows that she been peeping through a hole

Peeping through a hole

They touch her with those filthy little hands
Abused, too afraid to cry
Just lyin' down there on a urine soaked floor
Can't move out, believe, dead bolt door

Without any clothes on
Mommy knows that she been peeping through a hole

They're watching the TV
Fucking on the floor
Mommy knows that she been peeping through a hole

Peeping through a hole
Yeah, yeah
